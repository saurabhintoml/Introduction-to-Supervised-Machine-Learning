# Introduction-to-Supervised-Machine-Learning
WEEK-1 
The first week was based on an introduction to Python and how to use Jupyter. This began with an introduction to Anaconda using the available resources 
https://neighborly-clover-184.notion.site/Resources-0d409b1d58664e06a60c91395c762afc with which we set up Anaconda. Other options available were Google Collab and Python, but it was preferred because Anaconda had better UI and many inbuilt applications.
The above-mentioned site also contains the Basics of Python, exception handling, an introduction to classes, and Python standard libraries.
