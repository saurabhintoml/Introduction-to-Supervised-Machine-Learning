# Introduction-to-Supervised-Machine-Learning
# WEEK-1 
The first week was based on an introduction to Python and how to use Jupyter. This began with an introduction to Anaconda using the available resources 
https://neighborly-clover-184.notion.site/Resources-0d409b1d58664e06a60c91395c762afc with which we set up Anaconda. Other options available were Google Collab and Python, but it was preferred because Anaconda had better UI and many inbuilt applications.
The above-mentioned site also contains the Basics of Python, exception handling, an introduction to classes, and Python standard libraries.

# WEEK-2 
This week was based on learning the basics of NumPy, Git, and GitHub, and Introduction to Neural Networks.
Basics of NumPy operations was learned using the PyCK resource available on YouTube(link- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93uKo-F9SSo). This lecture consisted of Numpy Basics, Multi-dimensional NumPy arrays, and NumPy libraries.
NumPy basics included Creating a NumPy array, practicing element-wise operations such as %timeit, list(), arrange(), dtype, ndim, shape, size, astype, etc. We also practised array operations such as np.matrix(), np.transpose(), np.dot(a,b), np.copy(x), np.arange() and more.
Then we learned Broadcasting, I/O, Linear Algebra, String Manipulation and Statistics.
To learn Git and GitHub fundamentals, we referred the following YouTube links-

For Introduction to Neural Networks we referred the playlist created by DeepLearningAI–

This playlist was set to be covered in week 2 and 3.
Until now I have completed videos of the the following topics-

• What are Neural Networks (NN)
• Supervised Learning with NN
• Why Deep Learning
• Binary Classification on images
• Computational graph of NN
• NN Notations
• Shorthand idea of NN Computations

# WEEK 3 AND 4 
This week was continuation of Neural Networks started in Week 2.
Topics covered this week are mentioned below-
• Details of neural networks
• Activation functions
• Importance of Non-Linear functions
• Derivatives of Activation Functions
• Gradient Descent for Neural Networks
• Backprogation Intuition
• Weight Initialization
• Deep Netwroks
• Forward and Backward prop
• Parameters and Hyperparameters
• Dropout Regularization
• Early Stopping
• Vanishing/Exploring Gradients
• Tackling Vanishing/Exploring Gradients via Weight Initializing
• Grad Check
• Mini Batch Gradient Descent
• Mini Batch Gradient Size
• Exploring Descent
• Xavier Weight Initialization
• Exponentially Weighted Averages
After this we learned about Tensorflow which is an open source platform for machine learning.
We also learned CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) and RNN(Recurrent Neural Networks) from the following links-
